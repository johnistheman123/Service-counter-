It looks like you were about to give this a try. I'd be happy to review your code, if you do.

If you like the way I taught this past year, you should consider transferring to the new
Cybersecurity CTE program at Davies Career and Technical High School this fall. Normally,
you would take an entrance exam and file an application, but as a transferring student from
an existing CTE program, you can skip much of that. Feel free to drop my name when you call and
inquire. You would be a _valuable_ addition to this new program.

Whatever you choose, please know that I am very proud of you, I appreciate your hard work,
and I wish you the very best for your future.
